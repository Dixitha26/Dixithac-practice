Each road is given some number. Before the Bike reaches the end of the road Joshua wants to know that out of three roads in which road the Bike will go. Help him in finding in which road the Bike will travel?
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int A,B,C,D;
    cin>>A>>B>>C>>D;
    if(A%D==0)
    {
        cout<<"Bike 1 goes into road A";
    }
     else if(B%D==0)
    {
        cout<<"Bike 1 goes into road B";
    }
     else if(C%D==0)
    {
        cout<<"Bike 1 goes into road C";
    }
     else
    {
        cout<<"No path exist ";
    }
}
