Dear Friend, Make Binfon to understand what is meant by days,week, months and year. Teach him about the conversion of days in to years, weeks and days using a program.

INPUT FORMAT:

    int n,totalyears,totalweeks,totaldays;
    cin>>n;
    totalyears=n/365;
    totalweeks=(n%365)/7;
    totaldays=n-(totalyears*365+totalweeks*7);
    cout<<totalyears<<endl<<totalweeks<<endl<<totaldays;
